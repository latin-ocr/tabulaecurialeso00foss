The appointment of a keeper of the scal—custos sigilli-a
instead of a chancellor‚ was now introduced.

During the occasional absenees of 1110 chancellors and
keepers‚ the seal was sometimes placed in the temporary
custody of the keepers of the wardrobe or officers of the
household, whose names it has not been deemed necessary
10 insert.

The division of the 0011115 commenced in this reign, but
was not definitely established 1111 near the end of it3 nor
then with such sufficient distinctness as 10 enable lists 10 be
prepared appropriating the judges to their different courts3
but after this reign the judges of the Courts of Equity,
King’s Bemh, Common Pleas, and Exchequer, will be
placed in separate tables.

In this reign 1110 first instance occurs of an advocate being Ἴ ’

regularly employed in the king’s affairs.

Lawrence del Brok is recorded as pleading for the king,
⁶ sequitur pro rege‚’ for fourteen years from 1253 to 1267 3
when he was made a justicier.

John de Lythegrenes is also mentioned in the same
manner in Northumbcrland.
