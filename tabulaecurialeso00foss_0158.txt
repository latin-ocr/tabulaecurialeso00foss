‘It is impossible to speak too highly of the care and research with which
these interesting memorials have been compiled by Mr. Foss from the original
sources.'—Ed2'7zbzcr9h Review.

‘ Too high praise cannot be awarded to Mr. F oss for careful and painstaking
research ....... He has rejected the husk of arcliaeology‚ and presented the kemel.
His conclusions are not merely sound, his logic is inventive.'—Speetator.

‘It supplies what was much wanted‚—-a regular and progressive account of
English institutions. The result is a correction of many crrors, an addition of
much new inffirmation, a better general view of our strictly legal history than
any other jurist, historiam, or biographer had heretofore attempted to give?

Evamz'ner, lst. Notz'ee.

‘ Apart from any biographical interest belonging to it, the work, in its com-
plete state, will supply a regular and progressive account of English legal
institutions, such as exists in no other equally accessible form in our language.’

Examiner, 2nd. Notioe.

‘ Mr. Foss’s work will form a nearly complete history of the English Bench

and Bar, told briefly, yet with the accuracy of a most able and diligent
investigator]—Eoeamz·22er, 3rd. Notiee.

‘ Lord Campbell boasts of “the Cancellarian mummies which he has dug up
and exhibited to the public;’' but Mr. Foss may boast of a higher claim to
praise, 111 having given to the persons whom he has drawn from the shades of
a long and all but hopeless obscurity‚ the truth of an historical interest, and the
animation of a real existence.'— sztleman's Maqazz'ne, ist. Notiee.

‘It is the distinction of Mr. Foss's book, that he builds everything up 011
authority, and quotes authority for everything ....... He has written a book which
has added more to our knowledge of legal history than any single work pub-
lished since Madox’s “ History of the Exchequer,''-—a book which is essentially
sound and truthful, and must therefore take its stand in the permanent literature
of our country.'—Gentlemczn’s Maycm'ne, 2ml. Note'ee.

‘ Mr. Foss's work carries with it proofs of originality, alike in its materials
as in the well-balanced judgments it pronounces; and he may be considered
the Hallam of our judicial history.’—L7'terary Gaectte.

‘ It is a work of great erudition5 and full of antiquarian interest!
Satzcrdccy Review.

‘To have successfully supplied a chasm in the legal literature of England
is no unenviable success. To have executed the task with such a depth and
variety of research, with such vigilance, acuteness, judgment, and skill, as to
set all future competition at ἀεί-131100, and produce at once a work, perfect in
its kind, is assuredly high praise. This high praise, however, and nothing less
than this, is fairly due to Mr. F offis—Lazo Mayazz'ne and Review.

‘ It is happy for our legal literature that the Lives of our J udges should have
been undertaken by such a man as Mr. Foss. We happen to know that the
highest opinion is entertained of his work by those who are best qualified to
judge of it, the J udges of our own days; and the writer of this article has cited
it as a work of authority in the Court where Lord Campbell presides, when his
Lordship recognised the learning and the accuracy of his liter-ary riva&
