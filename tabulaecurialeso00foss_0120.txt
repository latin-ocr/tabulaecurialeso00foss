Oct. 2⁴, 1610, John Sozherton (²).

The name of CURSITOR BARON, as a distinct officer, first
occurs in this reign. At the death of John Sotherton (l)
all 1110 remaining barons had been previously serJeants, and
were denominated “ Barons of 1110 Coif.” To those only of
that degree was 1110 judicial business of the court in future
entrusted. 13111 as they were ignorant of the formal duties
in reference 10 1110 1·ον011110, which had been previously per-
formed by all the old Barons of 1110 Exchequer, a new officer‚
conversant with the routine, but of secondary rank, was
appointed, whose duties being 10 audit the sheriffs' accounts
and 10 attend 10 011101· matters of course, received 1110 name
of Cursitor Baron.

In the reign of William IV. many of these duties were
transferred to the commissioners for auditing the public
accounts3 and in the reign of Victoria, the office, having
become almost a sinecure‚ was abolished.

The names of the Cursitor Barons will be added at the

foot of the tables of 1110 Court of Exchequer.
