vi INTRODUCTION.

The J ustices Itinerant, and of Trailbaston, could not, of
course, be inserted in any of the tables ; but their names are
given in the list, and their lives have been added to the
others recorded in ‘ The Judges of England.’

The date of the commenoement and termination of the
reign of each sovereign immediately follow his name3 and
to all the judicial changes Ι have prefixed the regna] year.

The names of the Attorney and Solicitor-Generals, from
the time of the institution of those offices‚ will, I anticipate,
be acceptable to the Profession 3 as will also the list which I
have appended of the Judges whose Reports have been
published.

With the hope that this compilation (which is prin-
cipally extracted from my larger work) may be serviceable
to both legal practitioners and students‚ and not wholly
useless to the antiquary and historian, I consign it to that
fate which it may be found to deserve.
