INTRODUCTION.

THIS WORK has been undertaken for the purpose of satis-
fying the very general desire expressed by my professional
friends to be supplied with a simple Catalogue of the
Judges of the land, and of their station and succession in
the different Courts of WVestminster HalL thus relieving
them, in their forensic preparations, from the necessity of
rcsorting to voluminous reports, and of searching, in works
not· easily accessible‚ for the precise period of the authority
they wish to cite, the Court in which the judgment was pro-
⁴ nounced, and the actual members who then sat on its Bcnch.
It commences with an Alphabetical List of all the Equity
and Common Law J ridges, from the time of the Conquest to
the present date3 with the reigns in which they flourished,
and the different Courts in which they at any time sat.
Then follow Tables of these Courts in each successive
reign, with, their respective staffs during every year, and
almost every day, of its continuance 3 so that the precise
position of each Judge may be seen in the several reigns and
Courts attached to his name in the alphabetical list.
Previous to the final division of the Courts of King’s
Bench, Common Pleas, and Exchequer, which was not
completely effected till the reign of Edward L, no satisfactory
arrangement of them could be adopted. The earlier Common
Law Judges have been therefore denominated simply
‘ Justiciers‚' and are not included in any of the tables 3 but.
from the reign of Edward I. there is a regular succession of
tables for all the Courts.
